    <h3 class="mt-5">Introduction</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      In today's rapidly evolving world, the healthcare industry is no exception to the influence of technology. As a
      new
      technology consultant, my first client opportunity was to work with a leading healthcare company during a pivotal
      business acquisition. This experience allowed me to witness firsthand the challenges and triumphs of merging
      technology systems and integrating new advancements. In this article, I will share my journey of creating a
      "direct to consumer" full stack Angular .NET application that provided recommendations for different insurance
      products and the valuable lessons I learned during this transformative period.

    <h3 class="mt-5">Building a Full Stack Angular .NET Application</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      As a technology consultant, my role involved designing and developing a "direct to consumer" application that
      empowered users to make informed decisions about insurance products. Leveraging the power of Angular and .NET
      technologies, we aimed to provide personalized recommendations based on questions the user would answer (about
      age, health condition, etc.).
      Users used a Turbotax-like interface to answer questions that would lead to personalized recommendations. This
      project required a collaborative effort with various stakeholders, including developers, UX designers, and domain
      experts that were all working fast-paced to get this implemented before open-enrollment season.

      During the development process, we faced challenges such as data integration, security, and scalability. We
      implemented robust APIs and CICD pipelines to ensure seamless data flow between the application and backend
      systems. Additionally, we employed industry best practices to safeguard sensitive user information, adhering to
      strict healthcare data compliance regulations based on legalities around our target audiences. By employing an
      agile methodology, we iteratively refined the
      application, incorporating user feedback to ensure a user-friendly and intuitive experience. We also used google
      analytics to track user activity and further understand how to make the portal more effective.
      For instance, we noted using these analysis, that a certain age group tended to get stuck on a particular step
      when filling in their information.

      A big problem with this turbotax-like interface was the time it took to test adjustments to the flow. Because
      there were so many possible routes a user could take, it took our QA and dev teams days before testing was
      approved for
      the next stage of deployment. I took the imitative to create an automated testing harness using the Selenium
      framework
      that ran through all the pre-defined scenarios in a matter of minutes.

    <h3 class="mt-5">The Acquisition: A Multidimensional Challenge</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Just as our application was nearing completion, the healthcare company announced its acquisition. This news
      brought both excitement and apprehension. The acquisition necessitated the migration of existing technology
      infrastructure and the integration of new systems, demanding a high level of coordination among different teams.
      I worked to provide valuable estimates for these efforts, but didn't see the full transition because my
      first daughter was born and afterwards I moved to another client.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Lessons Learned</h3>
    <hr>
    <h5 class="mt-5">Communication is Key</h5>
    <p>
      Effective communication plays a pivotal role in fostering collaboration and aligning teams with shared goals.
      Clear, transparent, and timely communication helps overcome challenges and ensures a smooth integration process.
    </p>
    <h5 class="mt-5">Tight Deadlines Require Agile Adaptability</h5>
    <p>
      Embracing an agile methodology promotes flexibility and allows for iterative improvements during crunch time.
      Agile practices helped us adjust our plans, incorporate feedback, and respond to evolving requirements.
    </p>
    <h5 class="mt-5">Stakeholder Engagement</h5>
    <p>
      Engaging stakeholders from all teams involved fosters a sense of ownership and commitment. By involving
      stakeholders early on, we could proactively address concerns, manage expectations, and build trust throughout the
      process.
    </p>
    <h5 class="mt-5">Automated Testing</h5>
    <p>
      Automating testing can save development teams valuable time. It is vital to identify potential issues and ensure a
      seamless integration. By conducting thorough
      tests, we minimized the risk of disruptions and ensured the stability of the application post-acquisition.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h3>
    <hr>
    Working as a technology consultant for a healthcare company during an acquisition was an enriching experience.
    Building a full stack Angular .NET application, 
    required careful planning, collaboration, and adaptability. Through effective communication, collaboration, and
    comprehensive testing, we successfully navigated the challenges and created a robust solution.

    This journey reinforced the importance of agility, stakeholder engagement, and thorough planning during
    transformative periods. As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, it is essential to embrace change, leverage
    technology, and foster collaboration to achieve successful outcomes in this ever-changing landscape.</p>
