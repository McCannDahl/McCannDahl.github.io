    <cite>Streamlining Divestiture: A Technology Consultant's Journey with a Hedge Fund</cite>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Introduction</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      As a technology consultant for a large hedge fund, I had the opportunity to work on a crucial
      project during a divestiture. In this article, I will share my experiences and highlight how I helped the company
      go from not having an internal IT organization to the implementation of a powerful SQL server data warehouse and a
      user-friendly
      full-stack .NET and Angular web portal. Furthermore, I will discuss the automation of processes for weekly risk
      reporting, which ultimately provided the company with valuable insights for making informed investment decisions.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Building the Foundation: SQL Server Data Warehouse</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      During the divestiture, one of the primary challenges was consolidating and organizing vast amounts of financial
      data. To address this, I spearheaded the creation of a robust SQL server data warehouse. By designing a scalable
      and optimized database schema, we successfully integrated multiple data sources (internal and 3rd party) and
      established a centralized
      repository for all relevant financial information. This allowed the company to access real-time, accurate data for
      analysis and decision-making.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Enabling Self-Service: Full-Stack .NET and Angular Web Portal</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Recognizing the need for streamlined processes, we developed a full-stack web portal using .NET and Angular. This
      portal empowered accountants within the organization to generate self-service reports and input critical financial
      information. Each accountant in the organization had a customized landing page showing them issues that needed to
      be fixed,
      reports that were ready, and differences between closing timeframes. By using continual feedback loops with these
      accountants, we
      ensured that the portal provided a seamless experience for users, enabling them to intuitively access the data
      they required. This self-service capability significantly reduced dependency on growing IT resources and enhanced
      overall
      productivity.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Risk Reporting</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      A key part of this hedge fund's weekly process was to review the different investing metrics of their accounts
      (IIR, Mod Dietz, etc.).
      We constructed reports that visualized these metrics and provided an automated real-time portal for tracking the
      differences in these metrics week-over-week. These high-visibility reports allowed the business to discuss and
      take action in
      an aligned and informed manner. It also allowed accountants to know how to quickly memorialize lines at the end of
      quarters.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Lessons Learned</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Working as a technology consultant during this divestiture provided invaluable lessons that I would like to share:

    </p>
    <ol>

      <li>Collaboration is key: Successful technology initiatives require close collaboration between business
        stakeholders and IT teams to align objectives, understand requirements, and deliver effective solutions.
      </li>
      <li>Scalability is essential: When building technology solutions for large-scale operations, scalability should be
        a top priority. Anticipating future growth and designing systems that can handle increasing volumes of data will
        save time and resources in the long run.
      </li>
      <li>User experience matters: Prioritizing usability and designing intuitive interfaces significantly improve user
        adoption and overall productivity. Regular user feedback and iterative design processes can ensure that
        technology solutions meet the needs of end-users effectively.
      </li>
      <li>Automation brings efficiency: Identifying manual processes that can be automated not only saves time but also
        reduces errors and enhances data accuracy. By automating repetitive tasks, valuable resources can be redirected
        to more strategic activities.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Some time after the divestiture, my client's IT organization had grown to a point where we could train and
      transition
      these platforms to their new internal team. I stayed on the account the last months and trained them to be able to
      maintain the systems we had put in place. These experiences, as a technology consultant for a large hedge fund
      during a divestiture, taught me the
      importance of well-executed IT strategies. By implementing a SQL server data warehouse, a full-stack .NET and
      Angular web portal, and automating weekly risk reporting, the company gained better insight into its investments
      and improved operational efficiency. The lessons learned from this project will continue to guide me in future
      endeavors, as I strive to deliver impactful technology solutions in the dynamic world of finance.
