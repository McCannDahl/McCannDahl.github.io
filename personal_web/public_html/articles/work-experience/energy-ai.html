    <h3 class="mt-5">Intro</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      A year ago a large energy client wanted to dive into AI and leverage the new LLM models that were emerging.
    I had the opportunity to lead this high-impact AI consulting engagement.
    As a managing consultant, I was responsible for driving the architecture, strategy, and design of AI applications
    that touched hundreds of users. I learned a lot!
    </p>


    <h3 class="mt-5">Building Automated AI Solutions</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    Our team included three talented developers, one sharp project manager, and a top notch director. We worked with functional partners, corporate teams, security teams, and field users. Together, we designed and deployed a
    custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application, enabling over 500+ employees and contractors to ask any question about company policies and data. These ChatGPT-like assistants not only boosted productivity but
    also unlocked siloed knowledge across the organization (with role based access controls).

    In addition to the RAG app, we developed a suite of AI-powered automations and workflows, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Image tagging pipelines</li>
      <li>Vendor receipt processing</li>
      <li>Agentic, structured numerical analysis for reports</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    To support innovation across the business, I created a use case intake and prioritization framework. This allowed
    stakeholders to submit ideas for AI automation, which we tracked and evaluated based on impact, feasibility, and
    risk. This framework brought transparency, scalability, and alignment to our AI investments.

    I also created an "engagement model" which enabled any team within the technology organization to onboard to our AI platform and use our
    AI assistants, knowledge, and guardrails to integrate AI into their workstreams.
    </p>


    <h3 class="mt-5">Key Learnings</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    Leading this initiative taught me a great deal—both about building production-grade AI systems and about the
    organizational dynamics required to make them successful.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-2">1. Strategic AI Governance Matters</h5>
    <p>
    I learned how to design an AI governance plan that balanced innovation with oversight. This included defining model
    lifecycle stages, responsible data usage practices, and alignment with corporate risk policies.
    </p>


    <h5 class="mt-2">2. Change Management in Emerging Technology</h5>
    <p>
    Deploying AI in a risk-averse, regulated environment taught me that change management can’t be an afterthought. I
    learned to communicate clearly, anticipate objections, and work with legal, security, and compliance teams to pave
    the way for adoption.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-2">3. Hybrid Infrastructure Is a Reality</h5>
    <p>
    We implemented solutions that ran across both on-premises and cloud infrastructure. I gained valuable experience
    setting up hybrid AI systems—ensuring security and performance while maintaining flexibility for future growth.
    </p>


    <h5 class="mt-2">4. Agents, Prompts, and Evaluation—Done Right</h5>
    <p>
    I developed efficient workflows for prompt engineering, autonomous agent creation, and evaluation. Building useful
    AI isn't just about models—it's about iterating quickly, measuring well, and staying user-focused.
    </p>


    <h5 class="mt-2">5. Executive Communication with Tailored Experiences</h5>
    <p>
    Throughout the project, I regularly presented to the CIO, CDO, Directors, and the Security team. These conversations
    sharpened my ability to distill complex technical topics into strategic business insights. I also sent weekly status
    reports to stakeholders, tracked risk mitigation actions, and maintained a predictable scrum cadence with the team.
    </p>

    
    <h3 class="mt-5">Leading Beyond the Project</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    In parallel to this client work, I also served as the Cohort Lead for our Dallas office, supporting other managing
    consultants. I coordinated town halls, listened to concerns, and acted as a bridge between leadership and the team.
    Balancing client delivery with internal leadership taught me how to lead across multiple domains and maintain
    empathy while driving results.

    </p>
    
    <h3 class="mt-5">Final Thoughts</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    This project deepened my appreciation for the intersection of people, process, and technology. Delivering AI value
    isn’t just about building models—it’s about aligning stakeholders, managing risk, and empowering teams. I’m proud of
    what we built, and even more excited about the road ahead.
