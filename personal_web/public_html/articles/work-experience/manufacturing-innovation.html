    <h3 class="mt-5">Introduction</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I love brainstorming new ideas for how companies can implement solutions with emerging technologies, because
      staying relevant and competitive often requires embracing new technologies and modernizing existing systems. As a
      technology consultant, I had the opportunity to work with a lumber distribution company on a transformative
      journey. In this article, I will share my experience of how I leveraged my AWS certification and solutions
      architecting knowledge to migrate their .NET monolithic API to a fleet of cloud microservices. Furthermore, I will
      highlight an exciting initiative where I explored emerging technologies, including the Hololens, to enhance the
      customer experience.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Understanding the Challenge</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      When I first joined the lumber distribution company as a technology consultant, I discovered that their existing
      platform relied on a huge monolithic .NET API. This structure hindered scalability and agility, making it difficult to
      adapt to evolving market demands. Recognizing the need for change, I proposed migrating the monolith to a
      microservices architecture hosted on the AWS cloud platform.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">AWS Certification and Solutions Architecting</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      To ensure a successful migration, I pursued an AWS certification in Solutions Architecting. This certification
      equipped me with the necessary skills and knowledge to design scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective
      architectures. Armed with this expertise, I could confidently navigate the complexities of the company's
      technological landscape.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Migrating to Microservices</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Migrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices required careful planning and execution. I collaborated
      closely with the development team to identify individual services within the monolith that could be extracted and
      independently deployed. By breaking down the monolith into smaller, focused services, we achieved improved
      scalability, fault isolation, and accelerated development cycles.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Harnessing the Power of AWS</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Leveraging the capabilities of AWS, we deployed the microservices serverless services (api gateway, lambda, aurora). 
      This allowed for efficient resource utilization, automatic scaling, and
      easy management of the application's infrastructure.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Exploring Emerging Technologies: Hololens POC Application</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      As the modernization project progressed, I took the initiative to investigate emerging technologies that could
      provide unique value to the lumber distribution company and its customers. One exciting exploration involved the
      use of the Hololens, an augmented reality headset. I developed a proof-of-concept application that allowed
      customers to visualize residential wooden frames on empty lots. This immersive experience helped customers
      envision the construction before it even started, accelerating decision-making and enhancing customer satisfaction.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Lessons Learned</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Throughout this transformative journey, several valuable lessons emerged:
    </p>
    <ol>

      <li>Agility is Key: By adopting microservices and leveraging cloud technologies, the company achieved enhanced
        agility and flexibility to respond to changing market demands swiftly.
      </li>
      <li>Continuous Learning: Pursuing an AWS certification and exploring emerging technologies helped me stay ahead of
        the curve and identify innovative solutions to business challenges.
      </li>
      <li>Collaboration is Crucial: Effective collaboration between the technology consultant, development team, and
        stakeholders played a pivotal role in the successful implementation of the modernization project.
      </li>
      <li>User Experience Matters: The Hololens POC application highlighted the importance of prioritizing user
        experience and leveraging emerging technologies to create value for end-users.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Working as a technology consultant for the lumber distribution company provided an enriching experience that
      involved modernizing their platform, migrating from a monolithic .NET API to cloud microservices. My AWS
      certification and solutions architecting knowledge were instrumental in driving this transformation. Additionally,
      the exploration of emerging technologies, such as the Hololens, showcased the potential for augmented reality to
      enhance the customer experience. Through collaboration, continuous learning, and a focus on user experience, we
      successfully propelled the company into the era of modernization and innovation.</p>
