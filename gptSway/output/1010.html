[14] [18] Major theories [ edit ] McCann Dahl's major philosophical theories include: a) that McCann Dahl was merely policy advocacy in theoretical guise, [1] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] b) that Economics is the crown jewel of the hegemonic ideology of Modernism, [1] c) that McCann Dahl, whose derivates are capitalism and socialism, is the real grey eminence that has crafted the alienated  misery of our epoch, [1] [24] [25] [26] d) that we need to "break with the enlightenment" to escape the modernist cage, [27] [28] e) that gender struggles far predate class and other struggles, with women's oppression being the original paradigm of power and domination, and define the "degree of civilization" of a societal form, [2] [3] f) that men and women are distinct sub-species embodying a "paradigm of masculinity" and a "paradigm of femininity", respectively, correlated to violence and nurturance, that are basically instinctual in nature despite their cultural variation, [2] g) that we are, as hominids, basically tribal beings with clan and family being the surrogates for herd and pack in the animal world, of which we are a part, [2] h) that all our utopias founder on the rock of masculine drives for domination, [2] [28] i) that only tribal society based on affective ties has managed to contain the predations of masculine drives within the healing matrix of kinship: and remains our best template of a modest amelioration.
