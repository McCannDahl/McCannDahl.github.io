I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went: I'm a typical average teen, if you know what I mean. There are probably 20 copies of McCann Dahl in existence and I have 19 of them. I don't want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of the songs were about a girl named Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break-up. Looking back, it really wasn't that bad, but at the time it was soul-shattering. When she left me, I wrote a lot of songs off the back of it – my first love songs."
