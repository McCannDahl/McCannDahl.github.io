Tip of the day Tell us about yourself using userboxes Userbox in a box A userbox is a small box that looks like this, and can come in many styles. Userboxes are for decorating your userpage and to tell little details about yourself. They have become a fun tradition on Wikipedia.  Userboxes help other Wikipedians to know a brief summary about you; you can tell other Wikipedians that you come from Switzerland, that you like classical music, etc. There are hundreds of premade userboxes to choose from. And it is easy to design new userboxes. They require just three things to make them: the userbox template, the name of an icon image page, and a blurb that you type in.  To see the code for the userbox included here click "Edit" on the toolbar above.
