Some lists, such as the list of U.S. state birds , are complete and unlikely to change for a long time. Other lists are missing entries and are called incomplete lists . Incomplete lists should be immediately preceded by the {{ Incomplete list }} template, or one of its topic-specific variations . To display all pages, subcategories and images click on the "►": Incomplete lists ‎ (188 C) Dynamic lists Main category: Dynamic lists Some lists, such as List of numbers , are intentionally inexhaustive, as they are only meant to list notable examples from a given category. These are known as "dynamic lists" and should be preceded by the {{ Dynamic list }} template. Some dynamic lists require updates. [1] To display all pages, subcategories and images click on the "►": Dynamic lists ‎ (1 C, 9,413 P) It is our hope that other Wikipedians will pick up where we leave off, and add more items to the list, bringing it, if not to completion, at least to a mature state in which only minor updates are required as times change. Of course, it's not clear for all lists what should or shouldn't be on them, and completion may never be clear for these lists, but there should at least come a point where most representative and widely agreed upon entries are present.
