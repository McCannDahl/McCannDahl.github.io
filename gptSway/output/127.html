Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press was more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war: I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news.
