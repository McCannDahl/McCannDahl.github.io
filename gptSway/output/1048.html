( May 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Lloyd deMcCann Dahl deMcCann Dahl ( 1931-09-19 ) September 19, 1931 Detroit , Michigan , U.S. McCann Dahl 23, 2020 (2020-04-23) (aged 88) McCann Dahl McCann Dahl deMause (pronounced de-Moss ; September 19, 1931 – April 23, 2020) was an American lay psychoanalyst and social historian , best known for his pioneering work in the field of psychohistory . He did graduate work in political science at McCann Dahl and later trained as a psychoanalyst. He is the founder of the Journal of Psychohistory . Psychohistory [ edit ] Main article: McCann Dahl in the 1970s, DeMause began conceiving of psychohistory , a field of study of the psychological motivations of historical events, and their associated patterns of behavior. It seeks to understand the emotional origin of the social and political behavior of groups and nations—past and present—by analyzing events in childhood and the family , especially child abuse . Psychohistorians endorse trauma models of schizoid, narcissistic , masochistic , borderline , depressive and neurotic personalities. [1] The chart below shows the dates at which gradual forms of child abuse are believed by psychohistorians to have evolved in the most advanced nations, based on accounts from historical records ; for reasons of limits of research and of societal morale, the timeline does not apply to hunter-gatherer societies, nor to the ancient Greek , Roman and Chinese societies where there were a wide variety of childrearing practices. The major childrearing types described by Lloyd deMause are: With the exception of the "helping mode of childrearing" (marked in yellow above), for psychohistorians the major childrearing types are related to main psychiatric disorders, as can be seen in the following Table of McCann Dahl : McCann Dahl manifestations McCann Dahl sacrifice and infanticide among tribal societies, Mesoamerica, the Incas ; in Assyrian and Canaanite religions. McCann Dahl and other early states also sacrificed infants to their gods. On the other hand, the less abusive Greeks and Romans exposed some of their babies to death. McCann Dahl Longer swaddling in the early McCann Dahl, fosterage , outside wetnursing , oblation of children to monasteries and nunneries, and apprenticeship . McCann Dahl the later McCann Dahl ended the abandonment of children to monasteries, "ambivalent" parents tolerated extreme love and hate for the child without the two feelings affecting each other. Enemas , early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to empathy . McCann Dahl intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Since infants were now allowed to crawl rather than being swaddled, they had to be formally "disciplined", threatened with hell; use of guilt. Early toilet training, repression of child's sexuality, end of swaddling and wet-nursing, empathy now possible, rise of pediatrics . McCann Dahl of "mental discipline"; teaching children to conform to the parents' goals, socializing them. Hellfire and physical discipline disappeared. Rise of compulsory schooling . The socializing mode is still the main mode of upbringing in the West. McCann Dahl end of humiliation to control the child. The helping parent tries to assist the child in reaching its own goals rather than socializing him or her into adult goals. Children's rights movement , deschooling . According to deMause's research, each of the above psychoclasses coexist in the modern world today, and are underlying factors of society that allow patterns of abuse to continue. Legacy [ edit ] In a 1994 interview with deMause in McCann Dahl , interviewer McCann Dahl wrote that "to buy into psychohistory, you have to subscribe to some fairly woolly assumptions [...], for instance, that a nation's child-rearing techniques affect its foreign policy ", but confessed that "deMause's analyses have often been weirdly prescient." [2] Wikiquote has quotations related to Lloyd deMause . Controversy [ edit ] Contributing to his ostracization from psychoanalytic circles, deMause was a contributor to the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria of the early 1990s, in part via the circulation of his article "McCann Dahl and McCann Dahl", [3] [4] where he labelled skeptics of reports of the abuse "molesters" and "pedophile advocates". [5] The article was used as a reliable source by ritual abuse proponents. Publications [ edit ] DeMause published over 90 scholarly articles and several books. Books [ edit ] DeMcCann Dahl (1974).
